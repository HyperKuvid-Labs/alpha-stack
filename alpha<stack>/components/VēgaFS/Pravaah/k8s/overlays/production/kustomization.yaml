# Reference the common base manifests for the VēgaFS application.
# This points to the shared Kubernetes resource definitions.
bases:
  - ../../base

# Add production-specific resources to the overlay.
# The 'configmap.yaml' typically defines environment variables and
# application configurations tailored for the production environment.
resources:
  - configmap.yaml

# Apply patches to modify specific fields within resources inherited from the base.
patches:
  # Patch the main VēgaFS application deployment.
  # This patch commonly adjusts replica counts, sets robust resource limits/requests,
  # and ensures environment variables from the production config map are injected.
  - path: deployment-patch.yaml
    target:
      kind: Deployment
      name: vegafs-app # Assumes the base deployment's name for the VēgaFS app is 'vegafs-app'

  # Optional: Patch the Ingress resource.
  # This is used to define production-specific hostnames, enable TLS (e.g., via cert-manager),
  # or apply other routing rules relevant only to the production environment.
  - path: ingress-patch.yaml
    target:
      kind: Ingress
      name: vegafs-ingress # Assumes the base ingress resource's name is 'vegafs-ingress'

# Define image overrides for production.
# This ensures that the deployment uses a specific, stable, and versioned Docker image
# for the VēgaFS application in production, typically from a private registry.
images:
  - name: vegafs-app-image-placeholder # This should match the placeholder image name in the base Deployment
    newName: your-docker-registry.com/vegafs/app # Replace with your actual production image path
    newTag: v1.0.0-stable # Use a specific, production-ready tag (e.g., semantic versioning)

# Apply common labels to all resources managed by this kustomization.
# These labels help in identifying and managing production resources within the cluster.
