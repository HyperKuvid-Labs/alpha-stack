# VēgaFS: High-Performance File & Data Processing Engine

## Welcome to VēgaFS

**VēgaFS** (*Vēga*, Sanskrit for "speed" or "velocity") is a cutting-edge file and data processing engine designed for unparalleled performance and efficiency. Leveraging the power of modern programming languages and distributed systems, VēgaFS empowers users to manage, analyze, and transform vast quantities of file-based data with speed and precision.

Our mission is to provide a robust, scalable, and developer-friendly solution for organizations grappling with large data volumes, enabling faster insights and more efficient data workflows.

## What is VēgaFS?

VēgaFS is a unique hybrid system that combines the agility and extensive ecosystem of **Python** for its application layer, API, and orchestration, with the raw performance and memory safety of **Rust** for its core processing engine. This dual-language approach allows VēgaFS to deliver:

*   **Exceptional Speed:** Critical operations are offloaded to highly optimized Rust code, ensuring computations are executed at native speeds.
*   **Fearless Concurrency:** Rust's concurrency model enables efficient parallel processing across multiple CPU cores without common pitfalls.
*   **Developer Agility:** Python provides rapid development capabilities for user-facing interfaces, business logic, and integration with existing tools.
*   **Robustness:** Rust's compile-time guarantees minimize runtime errors, leading to a more stable and reliable system.

## Key Capabilities

VēgaFS is built to handle the most demanding file and data processing tasks:

*   **Parallel File Processing:** Execute user-defined operations (search, transform, validate) across millions of files concurrently.
*   **Efficient Directory Analysis:** Swiftly calculate statistics for massive directory trees, including total size, file/folder counts, and distribution by type.
*   **High-Throughput Bulk Operations:** Perform atomic and high-speed renaming, moving, and copying of files based on flexible patterns and rules.
*   **Comprehensive Job Management:** Submit, monitor, and retrieve results for long-running processing jobs via a robust API.

## Architectural Overview

VēgaFS employs a **Modular Monolith** pattern, providing deployment simplicity while maintaining clear separation of concerns:

*   **Python Application Layer:** This layer handles all external interactions (REST API via FastAPI, CLI), manages business logic, orchestrates jobs, and interacts with the database (PostgreSQL) and cache (Redis).
*   **VēgaFS Rust Core Library:** A high-performance, self-contained library that encapsulates all computationally intensive file processing logic. It's invoked directly from Python via `PyO3` bindings, ensuring minimal overhead. This core leverages `Tokio` for asynchronous I/O and `Rayon` for data parallelism.

This design ensures that heavy lifting is performed by the most performant components, while the Python layer provides a flexible and user-friendly interface.

## Technologies Under the Hood

VēgaFS is built upon a modern and robust technology stack:

*   **Languages:** Python (3.10+), Rust (Latest Stable)
*   **Web Framework:** FastAPI (Python)
*   **Python-Rust Bridge:** PyO3, Maturin
*   **Concurrency (Rust):** Tokio, Rayon
*   **Data Serialization:** Serde (Rust)
*   **Databases:** PostgreSQL (Metadata & Job Queueing), Redis (Caching)
*   **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose
*   **Orchestration:** Kubernetes (K8s)
*   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions / GitLab CI
