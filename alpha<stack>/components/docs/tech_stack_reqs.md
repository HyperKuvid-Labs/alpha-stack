# Technical Stack Documentation

### Project Title
**Project FusionFlow: High-Performance Data & File Processor**

### Core Technologies

#### **Programming Languages**
-   **Python (3.11+)**
    -   **Justification:** Python will serve as the primary language for the application's high-level logic, web API, and user interface. Its extensive ecosystem of libraries, rapid development cycle, and ease of integration make it ideal for building the user-facing components and orchestrating the overall workflow.
-   **Rust (Latest Stable)**
    -   **Justification:** Rust is chosen for performance-critical backend modules responsible for file and data processing. Its compile-time memory safety guarantees, fearless concurrency, and C-like performance without a garbage collector make it the perfect choice for CPU-bound and I/O-bound tasks involving large datasets, ensuring maximum throughput and efficiency.

#### **Frameworks & Libraries**
-   **Python Stack**
    -   **FastAPI:** A modern, high-performance web framework for building the REST API. Its asynchronous nature (built on Starlette and Uvicorn) allows for high concurrency, and its automatic data validation (via Pydantic) and API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI) significantly accelerate development.
    -   **PyO3 & Maturin:** The cornerstone for Python-Rust integration. `PyO3` provides Rust bindings for Python, allowing us to expose Rust functions and data structures as a native Python module. `Maturin` is the build tool used to compile the Rust code into a Python wheel for seamless distribution and installation.
    -   **Celery & Redis:** A robust distributed task queue system. `Celery` will be used to offload long-running file processing jobs to background workers, preventing the API from blocking. `Redis` will serve as the fast, in-memory message broker for Celery and as a general-purpose cache.
    -   **Streamlit:** A framework for building interactive web applications for data science and machine learning. It's chosen for its simplicity and speed in creating a user-friendly interface for uploading files, triggering jobs, and visualizing results.
    -   **Pydantic:** Used for data validation, serialization, and settings management. It integrates seamlessly with FastAPI and ensures data integrity throughout the application.

-   **Rust Stack**
    -   **Rayon:** A data-parallelism library for Rust. It makes it incredibly easy to convert sequential computations (like processing lines in a file or items in a collection) into parallel ones, fully leveraging multi-core processors.
    -   **Tokio:** An asynchronous runtime for Rust. It will be used for high-performance, non-blocking file I/O, enabling the system to handle thousands of concurrent file operations efficiently.
    -   **Serde:** A powerful framework for serializing and deserializing Rust data structures efficiently. It will be used for handling data formats like JSON, Bincode, or others when passing data or reading structured files.
    -   **jwalk / walkdir:** High-performance libraries for recursively walking directory trees. `jwalk` is particularly well-suited for parallel traversal.

#### **Databases & Storage**
-   **Object Storage: MinIO / AWS S3**
    -   **Rationale:** For storing large, unstructured datasets (the files to be processed), an object storage solution is ideal. It offers virtually limitless scalability, high durability, and is cost-effective. MinIO provides an S3-compatible interface that can be self-hosted for development or on-premise deployments, while AWS S3 (or GCP/Azure equivalents) offers a managed, scalable cloud solution.
-   **Metadata Database: PostgreSQL (15+)**
    -   **Rationale:** A relational database is required to store structured metadata about files, processing jobs, user information, and results. PostgreSQL is chosen for its robustness, reliability (ACID compliance), and powerful feature set, including JSONB support for semi-structured data and full-text search capabilities for querying file metadata.
-   **Cache & Message Broker: Redis (7.x)**
    -   **Rationale:** Redis serves two critical roles: as a high-speed, in-memory message broker for the Celery task queue and as a distributed cache for frequently accessed data (e.g., job statuses, user sessions), reducing load on the primary PostgreSQL database.

#### **Infrastructure & Deployment**
-   **Containerization: Docker & Docker Compose**
    -   **Rationale:** Docker will be used to containerize the Python application, Rust build environment, and all backing services (PostgreSQL, Redis). This ensures a consistent, reproducible environment across development, testing, and production. Docker Compose will orchestrate multi-container setups for local development.
-   **Orchestration: Kubernetes (K8s)**
    -   **Rationale:** For production deployments, Kubernetes is the de-facto standard for container orchestration. It will manage the deployment, scaling, and health of our application components. Its Horizontal Pod Autoscaler can be configured to automatically scale the number of Celery worker pods based on the length of the Redis queue, ensuring efficient resource utilization.
-   **CI/CD: GitHub Actions / GitLab CI**
    -   **Rationale:** A CI/CD pipeline is essential for automation and quality assurance. GitHub Actions or GitLab CI will be used to automate the process of linting, testing, building the Rust-Python wheel, containerizing the application, and deploying it to staging and production environments.

## Architecture Overview

### System Design Pattern
The architecture will follow a **Hybrid Monolith with a Worker/Queue Pattern**. The main application (API server and UI) is developed as a single, cohesive unit for simplicity, while the computationally expensive processing tasks are decoupled and handled by a scalable pool of background workers. This design provides a good balance between development velocity and operational scalability.

### Components & Data Flow

1.  **Client (Web UI / CLI):** A user interacts with the Streamlit web UI to select a directory or upload files for processing.
2.  **API Server (FastAPI):**
    -   Receives the API request (e.g., `/jobs`).
    -   Authenticates the user and validates the request payload using Pydantic.
    -   Creates a new job record in the **PostgreSQL** database with a `PENDING` status.
    -   Pushes a task message containing the job ID and parameters onto the **Redis** queue.
    -   Returns the job ID to the client immediately.
3.  **Task Queue (Celery & Redis):** Redis holds the queue of tasks. Celery brokers manage distributing these tasks to available workers.
4.  **Celery Workers (Python & Rust):**
    -   A pool of worker processes constantly listens for new tasks on the Redis queue.
    -   Upon receiving a task, a worker fetches the job details from PostgreSQL.
    -   The Python worker code invokes the high-performance **Rust Core Library** via PyO3 bindings, passing file paths or data references.
    -   The **Rust Core Library** performs the heavy lifting: parallel directory traversal (`jwalk`), multi-threaded file parsing (`Rayon`), and data transformation. It reads source files from and writes processed files to **Object Storage (S3/MinIO)**.
    -   As processing progresses, the worker updates the job status and any resulting metadata in the **PostgreSQL** database.
5.  **Data Flow for Status Update:**
    -   The Client UI periodically polls an API endpoint (e.g., `/jobs/{job_id}/status`).
    -   The API Server queries the PostgreSQL database for the current job status and returns it to the client, providing real-time feedback.




### Integration & APIs
-   **Internal API (Python <> Rust):** The integration between Python and Rust will be achieved through **PyO3**. This creates a low-overhead, in-process binding, where Python can call Rust functions as if they were native Python functions. This avoids network latency and is critical for performance.
-   **External API (REST):** The **FastAPI** application will expose a RESTful API for all external interactions. This includes job submission, status tracking, results retrieval, and user management. The API will be self-documenting via OpenAPI, making it easy for the frontend UI or third-party applications to consume.

## Requirements Documentation

### Functional Requirements
-   **File/Directory Ingestion:** Users can upload individual files, multiple files, or specify a path to a directory in object storage for processing.
-   **Configurable Processing Jobs:** Users can define and select different processing pipelines (e.g., "extract text", "resize images", "aggregate CSV data").
-   **Real-time Job Monitoring:** The UI provides a dashboard to view the status (pending, in-progress, completed, failed) and progress percentage of submitted jobs.
-   **Results Management:** Users can view, filter, and download the output files and a summary report of completed jobs.
-   **User Authentication:** A simple user authentication system to secure access to the application.

#### Sample User Stories
1.  **As a Data Analyst,** I want to specify a folder containing 10,000 CSV files and run an aggregation job, so that I can get a single summary file without crashing my local machine.
2.  **As a System Administrator,** I want to point the application to a directory of server logs and run a "grep" job to extract all lines containing "ERROR" or "FATAL", so that I can quickly diagnose system issues.
3.  **As a User,** I want to be notified via the UI when my long-running (30+ minutes) job is complete, so I do not have to keep the tab open and check manually.

### Non-Functional Requirements
-   **Performance:**
    -   API Response Time: < 200ms for all non-processing endpoints.
    -   Throughput: The system must be able to process at least 1 TB of data per day. The Rust core should be able to saturate I/O and CPU resources on a worker node.
-   **Scalability:**
    -   The number of Celery workers must autoscale horizontally based on the size of the task queue.
    -   The system should support up to 100 concurrent users submitting and monitoring jobs without performance degradation.
-   **Security:**
    -   **Data at Rest:** All data in object storage and the database must be encrypted.
    -   **Data in Transit:** All communication (API, database connections) must be encrypted using TLS.
    -   **Access Control:** Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to differentiate between user and admin roles.
    -   **Secrets Management:** Use a secure vault (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) for storing database credentials, API keys, and other secrets.
-   **Reliability & Availability:**
    -   The system should achieve 99.9% uptime.
    -   Processing jobs must be durable. Failed jobs due to transient errors should be automatically retried up to 3 times.
-   **Monitoring & Observability:**
    -   **Metrics:** Instrument the application with Prometheus to collect key metrics (e.g., job queue length, processing time, error rates).
    -   **Dashboards:** Use Grafana to visualize metrics from Prometheus.
    -   **Logging:** Centralized logging using an ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Grafana Loki for easy searching and analysis.
    -   **Alerting:** Configure Alertmanager to send notifications (e.g., via Slack or PagerDuty) for critical events like high failure rates or a stalled queue.

### Technical Constraints
-   **Core Technology Mandate:** The solution must use Python for high-level orchestration and Rust for performance-critical processing modules.
-   **Resource Limitations:** The initial deployment will be on a fixed budget, necessitating a focus on cost-effective cloud services and efficient resource utilization (e.g., using spot instances for worker nodes).
-   **Time-to-Market:** The initial MVP with core processing capabilities should be delivered within 3 months.

## Implementation Recommendations

### Development Approach
-   **Methodology: Agile (Scrum)**
    -   Work will be organized into 2-week sprints.
    -   Each sprint will aim to deliver a vertical slice of functionality (e.g., from UI button to Rust processing and back).
    -   Daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives will ensure alignment and continuous improvement.
-   **Testing Practices:**
    -   **Rust Unit & Integration Tests:** Use `#[cfg(test)]` modules in Rust. Test business logic and edge cases thoroughly. Use property-based testing (`proptest`) for robust input validation.
    -   **Python Unit & Integration Tests:** Use `pytest`. Mock external services (database, S3) to isolate components during testing.
    -   **Python-Rust Boundary Tests:** Create Python tests that specifically invoke the compiled Rust module to ensure the `PyO3` interface works as expected.
    -   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Use a framework like `Playwright` to automate browser interactions and test complete user flows.
    -   **CI-Driven Testing:** All tests must be executed automatically in the CI pipeline on every commit.

### CI/CD Design
-   **Tool:** **GitHub Actions**
-   **Workflow Stages:**
    1.  **Lint & Format:** On every push, run linters (`clippy` for Rust, `ruff`/`black` for Python).
    2.  **Test:** Run all unit and integration tests for both languages in parallel jobs.
    3.  **Build:**
        -   Compile the Rust library into a Python wheel using `maturin build --release`.
        -   Build the final application Docker image, copying the Python source code and the compiled Rust wheel.
    4.  **Publish:** Push the tagged Docker image to a container registry (e.g., AWS ECR, Docker Hub).
    5.  **Deploy:** On a merge to `main` or a git tag, trigger a deployment script (e.g., `kubectl apply`) to update the application in the staging/production Kubernetes cluster.

### Risk Assessment
-   **Risk 1: Python-Rust Interface Overhead**
    -   **Description:** Inefficient data serialization/deserialization between Python and Rust can become a performance bottleneck, negating the benefits of using Rust.
    -   **Mitigation:**
        -   Avoid passing large data structures by value. Instead, pass file paths and let Rust handle the I/O.
        -   For in-memory data, use efficient, zero-copy formats like **Apache Arrow** which has excellent support in both Python and Rust.
-   **Risk 2: Build & Dependency Complexity**
    -   **Description:** Managing a hybrid Rust/Python build environment can be complex and a source of friction for new developers.
    -   **Mitigation:**
        -   Use `maturin` to standardize the build process.
        -   Heavily document the development setup and build process in the `README.md`.
        -   Provide a `docker-compose.yml` that fully encapsulates the development environment, removing the need for local toolchain installation.
-   **Risk 3: Premature Optimization**
    -   **Description:** Spending too much time optimizing Rust code that is not a real-world bottleneck.
    -   **Mitigation:**
        -   Implement profiling early in the development cycle. Use tools like `perf` on Linux and `flamegraph` to identify actual hot spots in the Rust code before attempting optimization.
        -   Focus first on a correct and clean implementation, then optimize based on data.

#### Alternate Technologies
-   **Instead of Celery:** **Dask**
    -   **Pros:** Better suited for complex, graph-based numerical computations and native to the Python data science ecosystem.
    -   **Cons:** More complex to set up and manage than Celery for simple, independent task queuing.
-   **Instead of Streamlit:** **Dash** or **React/Vue**
    -   **Pros:** Dash offers more control over component layout. A full frontend framework like React provides maximum flexibility for a bespoke UI.
    -   **Cons:** Both have a much steeper learning curve than Streamlit and would increase development time for the UI.

```

### Initial Scaffolding
1.  Initialize the Python project with `poetry new --src fusionflow`.
2.  Inside `fusionflow/`, create the `crates/fusionflow-core` directory and initialize it with `cargo new fusionflow-core --lib`.
3.  Configure `pyproject.toml` to use `maturin` as the build system and link it to the `fusionflow-core` crate.

```toml
# In pyproject.toml
[build-system]
requires = ["maturin>=1.0"]
build-backend = "maturin"

[project]
name = "fusionflow"
requires-python = ">=3.11"
# ... other metadata
```

### Configuration
-   **Environment Variables:** Application configuration will be managed via environment variables. Use `pydantic-settings` to load them into a typed settings object.
-   **Local Development:** Create a `.env` file in the project root by copying `.env.example`. This file will be loaded by Docker Compose to configure the local services.
-   **Secrets:** For production, environment variables should be injected securely into the Kubernetes pods using K8s Secrets, which can be populated by a tool like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.
