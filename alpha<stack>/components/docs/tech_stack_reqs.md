# Technical Stack Documentation: High-Performance File & Folder Processing Application

This document outlines the technical architecture, requirements, and implementation plan for a high-performance application designed to handle large-scale file and folder processing tasks, leveraging the strengths of both Python and Rust.

## Technical Stack Analysis

### Core Technologies

#### Programming Languages
*   **Python (3.11+)**
    *   **Justification:** Python will serve as the primary application layer. Its rich ecosystem of libraries, ease of use, and rapid development capabilities make it ideal for building the user interface (API or GUI), orchestrating tasks, and handling application-level logic. It acts as the user-friendly "glue" for the high-performance core.
*   **Rust (Latest Stable Version)**
    *   **Justification:** Rust will be used to build the core processing engine. Its focus on performance, memory safety, and fearless concurrency is perfectly suited for CPU-bound and I/O-bound tasks like scanning massive directories, processing file contents, and multi-threaded operations. This avoids Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limitations for true parallelism.

#### Frameworks and Libraries
*   **Python Application Layer:**
    *   **Web API Framework:** **FastAPI (0.104+)**
        *   **Reasoning:** Provides a high-performance, asynchronous API framework that is easy to learn and integrates seamlessly with modern Python type hints. Ideal for building a web-based user interface or providing a programmatic API.
    *   **CLI Framework:** **Typer (0.9+)**
        *   **Reasoning:** Built on top of Click, Typer makes creating powerful and user-friendly Command Line Interfaces (CLIs) incredibly simple, using standard Python type hints. This is an excellent option for a developer-focused or automation-centric interface.
    *   **Python-Rust Bridge:** **PyO3 (0.20+)**
        *   **Reasoning:** The de-facto standard for creating Python extension modules in Rust. It provides safe, ergonomic, and efficient bindings between the two languages.
    *   **Build & Packaging:** **Maturin**
        *   **Reasoning:** A build tool specifically designed for building and publishing Rust-powered Python packages. It integrates with `cargo` and `pip`, dramatically simplifying the complex process of compiling the Rust core into a Python-installable wheel.

*   **Rust Core Engine:**
    *   **Parallelism:** **Rayon (1.8+)**
        *   **Reasoning:** A data-parallelism library that makes it incredibly easy to convert sequential computations (like iterating over a list of files) into parallel ones, automatically leveraging all available CPU cores.
    *   **Asynchronous I/O:** **Tokio (1.33+)**
        *   **Reasoning:** An asynchronous runtime for Rust. Crucial for non-blocking file I/O, allowing the application to handle thousands of concurrent file operations efficiently without waiting for each one to complete.
    *   **Directory Traversal:** **Walkdir (2.4+)** or **ignore (0.4+)**
        *   **Reasoning:** `walkdir` is a highly efficient library for recursively walking directory trees. The `ignore` crate builds on this with built-in support for respecting `.gitignore`-like rules, which is often a desirable feature.

#### Database Systems and Data Storage Solutions
*   **Primary Data:** The **local or network file system** is the primary data source. The architecture is designed to operate directly on files and folders.
*   **Metadata & Caching:** **SQLite (via Python's `sqlite3` or Rust's `rusqlite`)**
    *   **Reasoning:** For storing metadata, caching results of previous scans, or managing application state, SQLite offers a lightweight, serverless, and highly reliable embedded database solution. It requires no separate server setup and is perfect for both desktop and server-side applications.
*   **Scalable Storage (Optional):** **Amazon S3 / Google Cloud Storage**
    *   **Reasoning:** If the application needs to process datasets stored in the cloud, the Rust core can use the official cloud provider SDKs (e.g., `aws-sdk-rust`) for direct, high-performance access to object storage.

#### Infrastructure and Deployment Platforms
*   **Containerization:** **Docker**
    *   **Reasoning:** Encapsulates the application, its Python environment, and the compiled Rust library into a portable, reproducible container. This simplifies development, testing, and deployment across different environments. A multi-stage Dockerfile is recommended to keep the final image lean.
*   **Orchestration (for Web Service):** **Kubernetes** or **AWS ECS/Google Cloud Run**
    *   **Reasoning:** If the FastAPI-based application needs to scale to handle high request volumes, a container orchestrator can manage deploying, scaling, and networking multiple instances of the application container.
*   **CI/CD:** **GitHub Actions / GitLab CI**
    *   **Reasoning:** To automate the entire build, test, and deployment pipeline. This includes linting, running unit and integration tests for both Python and Rust, building the Rust wheel with `maturin`, building the Docker image, and deploying to the target platform.

## Architecture Overview

### System Architecture Pattern
The recommended architecture is a **Monolithic Application with a Core Library**.

*   **Description:** The main application logic, API endpoints, and user interaction are handled by a single Python service (the monolith). The performance-intensive, low-level file operations are delegated to a tightly integrated, high-performance Rust library (the core).
*   **Justification:** This pattern combines the rapid development speed of Python with the raw performance of Rust without the operational complexity of a full microservices architecture. It's a pragmatic and highly effective approach for this specific use case.




### Component Relationships and Data Flow
1.  **User Interaction:** The user interacts with the system via a defined interface (e.g., a Web UI, a CLI, or a REST API call).
2.  **Python Application Layer:** The Python (FastAPI/Typer) application receives the user's request (e.g., "Find all `.log` files over 100MB in `/var/data`"). It validates the input and prepares the parameters for the core engine.
3.  **Python-to-Rust Call (FFI):** The Python layer calls a function in the compiled Rust library via the `PyO3` bridge, passing arguments like the target path and filtering criteria.
4.  **Rust Core Engine:**
    *   The Rust function takes control. It uses `walkdir` to efficiently traverse the directory structure.
    *   It uses a `rayon` parallel iterator to process directory entries across multiple CPU cores simultaneously.
    *   For each file, it checks if it meets the filter criteria (extension, size, etc.).
    *   Results are collected into a Rust data structure that is designed to be efficiently converted back to a Python object.
5.  **Rust-to-Python Return:** The Rust engine returns the results (e.g., a list of file paths) back to the Python layer. Errors from the Rust side are properly converted into Python exceptions.
6.  **Response to User:** The Python application layer receives the data, formats it as needed (e.g., as a JSON response), and returns it to the user.

### Integration Patterns and APIs
*   **Primary Integration:** The Foreign Function Interface (FFI) between Python and Rust is the critical integration point. `PyO3` handles the translation of data types (e.g., Python `str` to Rust `String`, Python `list` to Rust `Vec`).
*   **External API:** If a web interface is chosen, the application will expose a **RESTful API** over HTTP. Endpoints will be designed around resources (e.g., `/scan`, `/jobs`, `/results`).

## Requirements Documentation

### Functional Requirements
*   **FR-1: Directory Scanning:** The system must be able to recursively scan a given directory path.
*   **FR-2: File Filtering:** Users must be able to filter files based on criteria such as:
    *   File extension (e.g., `.txt`, `.jpg`).
    *   File size (e.g., greater than, less than).
    *   Modification date (e.g., modified in the last 7 days).
    *   File name patterns (regex or glob).
*   **FR-3: Batch Operations:** The system must be able to perform batch operations on filtered files, including:
    *   Batch renaming.
    *   Batch moving/copying.
    *   Generating a manifest or report of the files.
*   **FR-4: Progress Reporting:** For long-running tasks, the system should provide progress feedback (e.g., via a callback mechanism from Rust to Python).
*   **FR-5: Error Handling:** The system must gracefully handle errors like permission denied, file not found, and invalid user input.

#### User Stories
*   **As a Data Scientist,** I want to quickly find all CSV files larger than 1GB in a nested project directory so that I can prepare them for analysis.
*   **As a System Administrator,** I want to generate a report of all duplicate files on a shared network drive to identify wasted space.
*   **As a Photographer,** I want to batch-rename thousands of RAW image files based on their creation date to organize my archive.

### Non-Functional Requirements
*   **NFR-1: Performance:** The system must be able to scan a directory containing 1 million files on a standard SSD in under 30 seconds. Batch processing should utilize all available CPU cores to maximize throughput.
*   **NFR-2: Scalability:** The core engine must scale vertically with the number of CPU cores. The web application (if built) must be stateless to allow for horizontal scaling behind a load balancer.
*   **NFR-3: Security:**
    *   **Path Traversal:** All user-provided paths must be sanitized and validated to prevent path traversal attacks (`/../../../etc/passwd`).
    *   **Permissions:** The application must operate with the minimum necessary file system permissions and handle access errors gracefully.
    *   **Resource Management:** Implement safeguards against operations that could exhaust disk space or memory (e.g., "zip bomb" type scenarios).
*   **NFR-4: Maintainability:**
    *   Code must be well-documented, especially the Python-Rust interface.
    *   A comprehensive test suite with high coverage for both Python and Rust codebases is required.
    *   Dependency management must be strictly handled by `poetry` (or similar) for Python and `cargo` for Rust.
*   **NFR-5: Monitoring:**
    *   The application must produce structured logs (e.g., JSON format) for easy parsing.
    *   For web services, expose a `/health` endpoint for health checks and a `/metrics` endpoint for Prometheus scraping.

### Technical Constraints
*   The primary interface between Python and Rust must be managed via `PyO3` and `maturin` to ensure maintainability.
*   The project will be developed in a monorepo to simplify dependency management and cross-language development.
*   Initial development will target Linux and macOS environments, with Windows support as a secondary goal.

## Implementation Recommendations

### Development Approach
*   **Methodology: Agile (Scrum)**
    *   Work will be organized into 2-week sprints.
    *   Each sprint will aim to deliver a small, vertical slice of functionality (e.g., implementing a single filter option from the UI down to the Rust core).
    *   This iterative approach allows for continuous feedback and adaptation.
*   **Testing Strategy:**
    *   **Rust Unit Tests:** Use `#[test]` modules within the Rust source to test individual functions and logic in isolation (e.g., testing a regex filter function).
    *   **Python Unit Tests:** Use `pytest` to test the API endpoints, input validation, and Python-side logic. Mock the Rust library calls during these tests.
    *   **Integration Tests:** Write tests in `pytest` that call the actual compiled Rust library to verify the end-to-end correctness of the Python-Rust bridge.
    *   **Performance Benchmarking:** Use tools like `hyperfine` to benchmark the Rust core functions and track performance regressions over time.
*   **Deployment Pipeline (CI/CD):**
    1.  **Commit:** Developer pushes code to a feature branch.
    2.  **Pull Request:** A PR triggers the CI pipeline.
    3.  **Lint & Format:** Run `clippy` and `rustfmt` on Rust code; run `ruff` and `black` on Python code.
    4.  **Test:** Run `cargo test` and `pytest`.
    5.  **Build:** If tests pass, the pipeline builds the release-optimized Rust wheel using `maturin build --release`.
    6.  **Containerize:** A multi-stage Dockerfile copies the built wheel and Python source code into a clean image.
    7.  **Push:** The final Docker image is tagged and pushed to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR).
    8.  **Deploy:** Merging to the `main` branch triggers a deployment of the new image to the staging/production environment.

### Risk Assessment
*   **Technical Risk 1: Python-Rust FFI Complexity**
    *   **Description:** Managing data types, error handling, and memory across the FFI boundary can be error-prone.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Define clear, simple data structures for communication. Avoid complex nested types where possible.
        *   Implement a robust error-handling strategy where Rust errors are converted into specific Python exceptions.
        *   Thoroughly document the function signatures and expected data types in the `lib.rs` file.
*   **Technical Risk 2: Build and Dependency Hell**
    *   **Description:** Juggling two languages, two package managers, and a compiler can lead to a complex and fragile build environment.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Strictly use `maturin` as the single source of truth for building the mixed-language package.
        *   Use a `pyproject.toml` file to define the project structure for `maturin`.
        *   Keep Python and Rust dependencies locked (`poetry.lock`, `Cargo.lock`) and committed to version control.
        *   Automate the entire build process in the CI/CD pipeline to ensure consistency.
*   **Alternative Technology Options:**
    *   **Go (Golang):** Another high-performance language. While fast, its CGO-based FFI with Python is generally considered less ergonomic and performant than Rust's `PyO3`.
    *   **Cython:** Allows writing C-like extensions directly in a Python-like syntax. It's a good option but doesn't offer the same level of memory safety guarantees and modern tooling as Rust.

```

### Key Configuration Requirements

**`pyproject.toml` (Root Directory):**
This file configures both the Python project (with Poetry) and the Rust extension (with Maturin).

```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "my-app"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "High-performance file processing."
authors = ["Your Name <you@example.com>"]
packages = [{include = "my_app", from = "src"}]

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.11"
fastapi = "^0.104.1"
uvicorn = "^0.24.0"
# The rust_core extension will be added here after the first build

[tool.maturin]
features = ["pyo3/extension-module"]
module-name = "my_app.rust_core" # How python will import it
```

**`rust_core/Cargo.toml`:**
This file defines the Rust crate's dependencies and tells Cargo to build a C-compatible dynamic library for Python.

```toml
[package]
name = "rust_core"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[lib]
name = "rust_core"
crate-type = ["cdylib"]  # Compile to a C-style dynamic library

[dependencies]
pyo3 = { version = "0.20.0", features = ["extension-module"] }
rayon = "1.8.0"
walkdir = "2.4.0"
```

**`rust_core/src/lib.rs` (Initial Example):**

```rust
use pyo3::prelude::*;
use std::fs;

/// A simple function to count files in a directory.
#[pyfunction]
fn count_files(path: &str) -> PyResult<usize> {
    // In a real implementation, use walkdir for recursion and rayon for parallelism.
    let count = fs::read_dir(path)?
        .filter_map(Result::ok)
        .filter(|entry| entry.path().is_file())
        .count();
    Ok(count)
}

/// A Python module implemented in Rust.
#[pymodule]
fn rust_core(_py: Python, m: &PyModule) -> PyResult<()> {
    m.add_function(wrap_pyfunction!(count_files, m)?)?;
    Ok(())
}
```
