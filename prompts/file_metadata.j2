You are analyzing a file from a project. Generate a detailed yet concise metadata description that captures its purpose, structure, and relationships.

## File Information

- **File Name**: {{ filename }}
- **File Type**: {{ file_type }} (e.g., .py, .html, .css)
- **Project Location**: {{ context }} (e.g., models, views, static/css, templates/)

### Project Idea
{{ refined_prompt }}

### Project Structure
```
{{ tree }}
```

### File Content
```
{{ file_content }}
```

### File Format
{{ file_output_format }}

## What to Include in Your Response

### Summary
A concise 2–3 sentence summary of the file's primary purpose and its role within the overall application.

### Core Components
Identify the main building blocks defined within the file based on its type:

- **For backend or logic files** (e.g., .py, .js, .java, .go, .rb): Mention the key classes, functions, APIs, controllers, services, or data models.
- **For frontend UI files** (e.g., .html, .jsx, .vue, .svelte): Describe the UI component or view it renders, the data it's expected to display, and any parent/child component relationships or layout inheritance.
- **For styling or asset files** (e.g., .css, .scss, .js, .ts): Explain the primary styling rules, animations, or client-side logic it contributes to the user interface. Note: Static asset files (images, videos, fonts) are not used in this project - all styling uses CSS and icon libraries.

### Internal Dependencies
List which other files within this project the file is directly coupled with (e.g., through import/require statements, component nesting, or API calls).

### External Dependencies
Mention any third-party libraries, frameworks, or external packages this file relies on (e.g., react, express, pandas, axios).

## Response Format

- Return only the raw description text (no markdown, bullets, or headings).
- Do not include any code or formatting artifacts.
