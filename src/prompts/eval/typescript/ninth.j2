WebAssembly Runtime with Type Bridge
Build a TypeScript-friendly WebAssembly loader that generates typed bindings from WASM modules. Implement memory management with views, support async instantiation with streaming compilation, and provide table imports for callbacks. Create zero-copy data transfer using SharedArrayBuffer, support WASI system calls, and optimize with workers for parallelism.

Key Features: Typed arrays for memory views, interface for WASM exports, namespace for module organization, utility types for function signatures, awaited type for async operations, type assertions for FFI
