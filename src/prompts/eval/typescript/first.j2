Type-Safe ORM with Query Builder
Build a fully type-safe ORM that infers result types from SQL queries at compile time. Implement template literal types for SQL parsing, conditional types for JOIN resolution, and mapped types for partial updates. Support transactions with isolation levels, connection pooling with pg/mysql2, and migration system with schema versioning. Generate TypeScript types from database schema.

Key Features: Template literal types for SQL DSL, conditional types for query result inference, branded types for entity IDs, builder pattern with fluent API, discriminated unions for query types, type guards for runtime validation
