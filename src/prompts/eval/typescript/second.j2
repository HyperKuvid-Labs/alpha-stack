Distributed Actor System with Type-Safe Messaging
Create an actor framework inspired by Akka with strongly-typed message passing. Implement actor supervision hierarchies, mailbox patterns with backpressure, and distributed actor references. Support actor persistence with event sourcing, cluster sharding for horizontal scaling, and at-least-once delivery guarantees. Use Bun/Node.js worker threads for parallelism.

Key Features: Generic constraints for message protocols, readonly tuples for immutable state, abstract classes for actor lifecycle, decorators for message handlers, async iterators for mailbox, namespace for actor addressing
