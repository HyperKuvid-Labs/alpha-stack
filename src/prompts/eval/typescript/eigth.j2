Type-Safe State Machine Library
Create a finite state machine framework with compile-time state transition validation. Implement hierarchical states with entry/exit actions, support parallel states with orthogonal regions, and provide time-based transitions. Generate state diagrams from type definitions, support state persistence with snapshots, and integrate with React/Vue for UI state management.

Key Features: Template literal types for state paths, never type for impossible transitions, type-level state validation, as const for state configs, exhaustive checking with switch, extends keyword for constraints
