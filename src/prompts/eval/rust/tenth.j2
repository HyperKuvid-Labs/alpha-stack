Implement a simple bump allocator (arena allocator) and use it as a global allocator.

Features:

Allocate from a fixed-size buffer by incrementing a pointer.

Implement GlobalAlloc trait (alloc, dealloc).

Use unsafe to manage raw pointers and alignment.

Track allocated vs used bytes.
Constraints:

No deallocation (bump pointer only moves forward).

Alignment handling (align pointer to requested alignment).

Panic on out-of-memory.
Demo:

Use #[global_allocator] in a small program.

Allocate Vec and String using your allocator.

Print allocator stats at program end.
Tests:

Allocation alignment correctness.

Multiple allocations don't overlap.

Demonstrate memory exhaustion handling.
