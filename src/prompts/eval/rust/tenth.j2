Compiler for Domain-Specific Language
Build a full compiler for a custom DSL targeting LLVM IR. Implement lexing with logos, recursive descent parsing, semantic analysis with symbol tables, and code generation. Support type inference using Hindley-Milner algorithm, implement a borrow checker for linear types, and optimize with constant folding and dead code elimination.

Key Features: Recursive types with Rc/Arc, arena-based tree structures, visitor pattern with pattern matching, LLVM bindings via inkwell, integration tests with golden file testing, error reporting with codespan
