Zero-Copy Network Protocol Parser
Create a high-performance parser for HTTP/2 and gRPC protocols using nom combinators and zero-copy techniques. Implement streaming parsing with backpressure, handle fragmented frames, and support header compression (HPACK). Design a state machine using enum-based type states to enforce protocol correctness at compile time.

Key Features: Lifetime annotations for zero-copy parsing, phantom types for type-state pattern, trait objects vs static dispatch tradeoffs, SIMD optimization with packed_simd, benchmarking with flamegraphs
