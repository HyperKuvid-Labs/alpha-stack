Database Query Optimizer with Cost-Based Execution
Design a SQL query optimizer that builds execution plans using dynamic programming and cost estimation. Implement a type-safe AST with recursive enums, support query rewriting rules, and generate optimized execution code. Use procedural macros to generate boilerplate for different join algorithms (hash, merge, nested loop).

Key Features: Visitor pattern with traits, arena allocation for AST nodes, Cow for copy-on-write optimization, macro_rules and proc_macros, GATs (Generic Associated Types) for query planning
