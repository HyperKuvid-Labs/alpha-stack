Distributed Key-Value Store with Raft Consensus

Build a production-grade distributed key-value database implementing the Raft consensus algorithm. Support cluster membership changes, log compaction, and snapshot transfers. Use tokio for async networking, implement custom serialization with serde, and design a write-ahead log with memory-mapped files. Test linearizability under network partitions and node failures using chaos engineering.

Key Features: Async/await patterns, trait-based state machine design, zero-copy serialization, custom error types with thiserror, property-based testing with proptest
