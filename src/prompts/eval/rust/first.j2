1. Custom Range Iterator with Step and Filter
Prompt:
Implement a custom iterator StepRange<T> that yields values from start to end with a configurable step size.

Requirements:

Implement Iterator trait with proper associated types.

Support generic numeric types (T: Add + PartialOrd + Copy).

Add a filter_even() method that returns another iterator adaptor (demonstrates iterator chaining).

Handle edge cases: zero step, negative ranges, overflow.
Write tests showing:

Consuming the iterator with .collect().

Lazy evaluation (iterator doesn't compute until .next() is called).

Composing with standard library adaptors (.map(), .take()).
