Lock-Free Data Structures Library
Implement a suite of concurrent data structures: MPMC queue, skip list, hash map, and B-tree using lock-free algorithms. Use compare-and-swap loops, hazard pointers for memory reclamation, and epoch-based garbage collection. Provide formal verification using model checking and linearizability testing.

Key Features: Advanced atomics (SeqCst, AcqRel, Relaxed), memory orderings deep dive, ABA problem solutions, crossbeam-epoch integration, stress testing with thread sanitizer
