Async Task Scheduler with Work Stealing
Build a multi-threaded task scheduler inspired by tokio's runtime but with custom scheduling policies. Implement work-stealing queues using crossbeam, support task priorities and deadlines, and provide CPU affinity controls. Design a reactor pattern for I/O events and integrate with io_uring on Linux.

Key Features: Pin and Unpin traits for self-referential types, custom Future implementations, unsafe Cell patterns for thread-local storage, conditional compilation for platform-specific code, integration testing with loom
