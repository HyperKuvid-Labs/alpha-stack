Implement a toy Raft-based log replication demo focusing on:

Leader election.

Log append + replication.
Simplifications:

All nodes run in a single process; they communicate over in-memory channels or loopback TCP.

No log compaction, no snapshots, no membership changes.
Node behavior:

States: follower, candidate, leader.

Timers for election timeout and heartbeats using goroutines + time.Timer.

Persist minimal state in memory: current term, voted-for, and log entries.
Interface:

Ability to submit a “command” (e.g., a string) to the cluster via the leader.

Print the final replicated log on each node.
Use context.Context or a higher-level controller to gracefully shut down the cluster. Write a simple test or demo that kills the leader (simulated) and shows a new leader being elected and continuing replication.
