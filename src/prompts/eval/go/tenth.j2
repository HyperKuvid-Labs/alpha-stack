BGP Router Implementation
Build a production-grade BGP router that speaks BGP-4 protocol with route reflection and confederations. Implement route selection logic, support policy-based routing with prefix lists and route maps, and handle graceful restart. Integrate with kernel routing table via netlink and provide a CLI using cobra.

Key Features: Custom binary protocol parsing, FSM implementation with channels, net.Conn for TCP session management, signal handling for graceful shutdown, integration tests with containerized topologies
