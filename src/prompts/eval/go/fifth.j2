Service Mesh Control Plane
Create a control plane for microservices that handles service discovery, traffic management, and policy enforcement. Implement xDS protocol for dynamic configuration, support circuit breaking with state machines, and provide distributed tracing integration. Use gRPC bidirectional streaming for configuration push.

Key Features: Protocol buffers with protoc-gen-go, reflection for dynamic message handling, context cancellation chains, rate limiting with golang.org/x/time/rate, custom gRPC interceptors
