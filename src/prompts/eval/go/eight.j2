Network File System with FUSE
Create a distributed filesystem using FUSE that supports concurrent reads/writes, client-side caching, and conflict resolution. Implement content-addressed storage with Merkle trees, support file versioning, and provide snapshot capabilities. Use gRPC for client-server communication with streaming for large file transfers.

Key Features: bazil.org/fuse for filesystem operations, sync.Map for concurrent caching, atomic file operations, inotify integration for file watching, custom error types implementing error interface
