Write a small library implementing consistent hashing for a list of backend nodes.
Features:

Configurable number of virtual nodes per physical node.

AddNode, RemoveNode, GetNode(key string) operations.
Implementation:

Represent hash ring as a sorted slice of hashes; use sort.Search to find the node for a key.

Provide a simple pluggable hash function interface to swap implementations (e.g., FNV-1a vs xxhash).
Add a demo program that:

Distributes 10,000 random keys across N nodes.

Prints distribution and rebalancing when a node is added/removed.

Shows percentage of keys that move when topology changes.
