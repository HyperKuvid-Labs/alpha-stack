Build a simple “task manager” REST API with endpoints:

POST /tasks (create)

GET /tasks (list)

GET /tasks/{id} (get)

DELETE /tasks/{id} (delete)
Organize code into packages:

api/handlers (HTTP handlers only).

domain (task entity + interfaces for storage).

storage/memory (in-memory implementation).

middleware (logging, request ID, simple auth stub).
Requirements:

Use interfaces in domain so handlers depend on abstractions, not concrete storage.

Provide a NewServer(deps ...) constructor that wires everything via dependency injection.

Include unit tests for handlers using a fake storage implementation.
