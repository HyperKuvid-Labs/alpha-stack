Build a small CLI tool that takes a list of URLs from stdin and fetches them concurrently using a bounded worker pool. Each worker should:

Fetch the URL with net/http, measure latency, and return status code + duration.

Use a WaitGroup to know when all work is done and a channel to distribute jobs.
Add:

Context-based cancellation (cancel all in-flight requests if any request exceeds a global timeout).

A thread-safe stats struct (using sync.Mutex) that tracks min/avg/max latency and total failures.
Expose a WorkerPool type that is reusable and unit-testable. implement in GO
