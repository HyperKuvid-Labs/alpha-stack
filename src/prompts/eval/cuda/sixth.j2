Develop a parallel radix sort implementation for sorting 10^7 32-bit integers on the GPU. Implement the algorithm using 4-bit or 8-bit radix passes with three phases per pass: histogram computation, prefix sum (scan), and data redistribution. Use shared memory for local histograms and demonstrate proper synchronization between passes. Compare performance against CUDA Thrust's sorting primitives and analyze scalability with varying input sizes and bit distributions (uniform, sorted, reverse-sorted).
