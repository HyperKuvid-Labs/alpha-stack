Implement GPU-accelerated Sparse Matrix-Vector multiplication using the Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) format. Your implementation should handle matrices with >10^6 non-zero elements and demonstrate three parallelization strategies: one thread per row, warp per row for medium-length rows, and block per row for very long rows. Include automatic load balancing that selects the appropriate kernel based on row length distribution. Validate against dense matrix multiplication and report achieved memory bandwidth and GFLOPS.
