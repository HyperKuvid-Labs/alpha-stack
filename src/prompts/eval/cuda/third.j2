Design a GPU-accelerated image processing pipeline that applies three sequential filters to a grayscale image: Gaussian blur (5×5 kernel), Sobel edge detection (3×3), and histogram equalization. Implement each filter as a separate CUDA kernel with proper synchronization. Use shared memory for filter convolutions to reduce global memory traffic. Structure your code with separate .cu files for each kernel and a common header for data structures. Compare performance against a single-kernel fused implementation and analyze the overhead of kernel launches
