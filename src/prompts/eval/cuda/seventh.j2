Real-Time Video Processing Pipeline
Design a GPU-accelerated video codec with H.264/H.265 encoding using NVENC. Implement custom kernels for color space conversion, resize with bicubic interpolation, and motion estimation. Support batched processing with CUDA streams, integrate with Video Codec SDK, and optimize memory transfers with pinned memory and async copies.

Key Features: NPP library integration, 2D texture memory, surface objects for video frames, constant memory for filter coefficients, warp shuffle for reduction, launch_bounds for occupancy
