Generate a 1920×1080 visualization of the Mandelbrot set with adjustable zoom level. Each thread computes one pixel's escape time (max 256 iterations). Implement dynamic parallelism where pixels that don't escape quickly spawn child threads for higher precision refinement. Add color mapping based on iteration count. Support interactive zoom/pan by regenerating regions.
