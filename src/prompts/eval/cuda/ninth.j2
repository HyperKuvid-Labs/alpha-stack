CUDA-Accelerated Computational Fluid Dynamics Solver
Build a Navier-Stokes solver using finite difference methods with GPU acceleration. Implement Poisson equation solver with conjugate gradient, support adaptive time stepping, and optimize stencil operations with shared memory tiling. Use multi-GPU domain decomposition with halo exchange, and visualize with CUDA-OpenGL interop.

Key Features: constant memory for stencil coefficients, grid-stride loops for scalability, cuSPARSE for sparse linear algebra, cooperative groups for block-wide reductions, texture memory for interpolation
