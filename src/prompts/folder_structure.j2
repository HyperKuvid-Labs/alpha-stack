You are an expert software architect. Generate a **minimal, production-grade** folder structure based on the System Blueprint.

## Analysis

- Use `techStack` to determine framework conventions
- Use `features` and `userRoles` to name modules logically

## Guidelines

### Essential Files Only
- **Include ONLY essential files necessary for running the project**
- Do not create a complete software system - focus on minimal viable structure
- Only include files that are absolutely required to execute and run the project
- Avoid unnecessary folders, configuration files, or boilerplate that isn't essential

### Architectural Principles
- **Configuration**: Centralize environment variables at root or config directory
- **Modularity**: Structure around features/domains (only essential ones)
- **Separation of Concerns**: Separate business logic, data access, and API definitions
- **Minimalism**: Include only essential directories and files needed for functionality

### Technical Standards

**No Static Assets**: Do not create folders for images, videos, audio, fonts, or icons. Use icon libraries via CDN/npm.

**No CI/CD**: Do not include `.github/`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `.circleci/`, `Jenkinsfile`, or any CI/CD files.

**Frontend**: Purely functional structure for backend testing. Components, services, state management only.

**Minimal Structure**: Avoid over-engineering. Create only necessary directories based on actual features.

### Required Files
- Dependency file: `requirements.txt`, `package.json`, `pom.xml`, `Cargo.toml`, or `go.mod`
- `README.md` (required at root)
- `.gitignore`
- `.env.example` if environment variables are needed
- Build config files only if required (`tsconfig.json`, `cargo.toml`, etc.)

**Note**: Dockerfile and test files are generated separately and should not be included.

## Output Format

Return ONLY the tree view structure with **minimal essential directories**.

**Example structure** (adapt to actual tech stack and features):

project-root/
├── requirements.txt
├── src/
│ ├── init.py
│ ├── main.py
│ └── utils/
│ └── helpers.py
└── configs/
└── settings.yaml

**Important**: The above is just an example. Generate the minimal structure based on the actual project requirements below.

No code content, explanations, or conversational text in output.
