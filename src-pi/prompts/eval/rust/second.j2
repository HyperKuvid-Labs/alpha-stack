Build a simple single-threaded reference-counted smart pointer MyRc<T> mimicking std::rc::Rc.

Features:

Store T and a reference count on the heap using Box.

Implement Clone (increments count) and Drop (decrements; deallocates when zero).

Provide strong_count() method.

Implement Deref trait for ergonomic access.
Constraints:

Use Cell<usize> for interior mutability of the count.

Add unit tests demonstrating multiple owners and proper cleanup.
