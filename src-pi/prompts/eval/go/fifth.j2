Implement a toy job queue HTTP service with endpoints to:

Enqueue a job (POST /jobs) with a small JSON payload.

Poll next job (POST /workers/next) for workers.

Mark job done / failed.
Architecture:

Packages: queue, storage, api, worker.

queue exposes an interface for enqueuing, reserving, and updating job status.

Provide an in-memory storage implementation, and an optional simple file-backed (append-only JSON log) implementation.
Use:

sync.Cond or channels to wake waiting workers when new jobs arrive.

A background goroutine to retry jobs that have been reserved but not completed within a timeout.
