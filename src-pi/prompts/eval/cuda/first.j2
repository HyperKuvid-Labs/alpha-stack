Implement a CUDA program that performs element-wise operations (addition, multiplication, and dot product) on two large vectors (10^7 elements). Your implementation should include proper thread indexing using threadIdx.x and blockIdx.x, handle arbitrary vector sizes, and demonstrate memory coalescing. Provide three kernel launch configurations (64, 256, 1024 threads per block) and profile the execution time for each. Include error checking for CUDA API calls and validate results against a CPU implementation.
