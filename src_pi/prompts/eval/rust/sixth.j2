Implement a lock-free bounded ring buffer queue using atomics.

API:

try_push(&self, T) -> Result<(), T> (fails if full).

try_pop(&self) -> Option<T> (returns None if empty).
Internals:

Use AtomicUsize for head/tail indices.

Use UnsafeCell or MaybeUninit array for storage.

Careful use of Ordering::Acquire / Ordering::Release.
Tests:

Single-threaded correctness.

Multi-threaded stress test (spawn producer and consumer threads).

Demonstrate zero allocation after initialization.

Show it's Send + Sync.
