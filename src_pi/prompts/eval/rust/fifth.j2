Build a tiny single-threaded async executor that can run Futures to completion.

Components:

Executor with a task queue (using VecDeque).

Custom Waker that re-enqueues tasks when woken.

A block_on(future) function that drives a future to completion.
Demonstrate:

Running multiple tasks concurrently (cooperative multitasking).

A simple TimerFuture that completes after a duration (use std::time::Instant and a waker).

Composing futures with .await.
Constraints:

No external async runtime (tokio/async-std).

Use std::task::{Context, Poll, Wake}.

Document limitations (no I/O, just timer-based).
