Implement a tiny RPC framework over TCP with the following features:

Custom binary framing: [length(uint32)][payload bytes].

Requests: {id, method, payload} as JSON.

Responses: {id, result, error} as JSON.
Server:

Register handlers by method name (e.g., "Add", "Echo").

Each connection handled by a goroutine; use another goroutine for decoding frames and dispatching.
Client:

Supports concurrent calls; use a map of id -> response channel guarded by a mutex.

Support context.Context for per-call timeout/cancel.
Show example methods and unit tests for:

Partial frame reception.

Timeouts.

Concurrent in-flight requests.
