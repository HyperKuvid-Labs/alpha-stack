Implement an in-process token bucket rate limiter and apply it to a dummy “external API client” interface.
Requirements:

A Limiter struct that:

Has capacity N tokens and refills at R tokens per second via a goroutine.

Exposes Allow() (non-blocking, boolean) and Wait() (blocking until token available or context done).

Use channels and time.Ticker for refill logic, and context.Context for cancellation.

Write a toy “API client” that simulates an expensive call with time.Sleep and is wrapped by the limiter.
Add tests showing:

Burst behavior up to capacity.

Respecting rate over time.

Context cancellation when waiting for tokens.
