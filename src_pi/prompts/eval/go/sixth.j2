Create a minimal WebSocket chat server that supports multiple rooms.
Packages:

hub (core types and interfaces).

transport/ws (WebSocket implementation, e.g. using gorilla/websocket or standard library).
Behavior:

Each room maintains:

A set of connected clients.

Broadcast channel for messages.

Clients send messages tagged with room ID; server broadcasts to all clients in that room.
Use:

Goroutines per client for read and write loops.

Channels in the hub for register, unregister, and broadcast actions.
Expose a small API to create/join rooms that could later be swapped for another transport.
