Implement a simple reverse proxy load balancer in front of a set of backend HTTP services.
Requirements:

Support round-robin and consistent-hash strategies (reusing your consistent hashing lib, if you want).

Periodic health checks (e.g., /health) via goroutines; unhealthy nodes are removed from rotation until healthy again.

Use context.Context for per-request timeout and cancellation.

Provide a config file (JSON/YAML) describing backends and strategy.
Expose basic metrics:

Requests per backend.

Failures per backend.

Current healthy/unhealthy status.
