Implement a simple in-memory LRU cache with:

Get(key string) (value any, ok bool)

Set(key string, value any)
Constraints:

Safe for concurrent access via multiple goroutines.

Use sync.RWMutex for guarding the internal map + doubly linked list (you can use container/list).

Optionally expose a Close() that stops a background goroutine which periodically evicts expired entries (TTL per key).
Add a small benchmark that compares:

Single-threaded vs multi-goroutine Get/Set performance.
