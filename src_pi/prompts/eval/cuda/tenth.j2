Implement 2D convolution for a 512×512 image using separable filters (Gaussian kernel). Split into two 1D convolutions: horizontal pass (rows) followed by vertical pass (columns). Use shared memory to cache rows/columns with halo regions. Compare against a naive 2D convolution kernel and measure the performance gain from separability. Include support for 5×5 and 9×9 kernel sizes.
