Build a basic GPU ray tracer that renders a scene with 100+ spheres using a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) for acceleration. Implement BVH construction on the CPU and traversal on the GPU, with each thread handling one pixel. Your implementation should support diffuse and reflective materials with recursive ray bouncing (depth limit of 5). Store the BVH in texture memory for cache optimization. Generate a 1920×1080 output image and report rays/second throughput. Include toggleable BVH visualization mode to debug traversal.
