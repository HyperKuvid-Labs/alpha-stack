Implement a multi-stage reduction algorithm to find the sum, maximum, and minimum of an array with 10^8 elements. Your solution should use shared memory for block-level reductions and demonstrate three optimization levels: basic reduction with divergent branches, warp shuffle instructions for warp-level reductions, and sequential addressing to avoid bank conflicts. Include a kernel that chains these reductions to compute mean and standard deviation in a single GPU pass.
