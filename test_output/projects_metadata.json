It contains a pure function for summing two numbers, separating the business logic from I/O operations to enhance testability. The primary component is the `add(num1, num2)` function, which accepts two numeric inputs (integer or float) and returns their sum. This module has no internal dependencies on other project files and uses no external third-party libraries, relying solely on built-in Python functionality."
