It contains step-by-step installation and usage instructions, including command-line examples for running the tool and the pytest test suite. A project structure diagram is included to explain the layout of the source code.\nThe README describes the roles and interactions of key project files, including the entry point `src/number_adder_cli/__main__.py`, the core logic module `src/number_adder_cli/core.py`, and the dependency file `requirements.txt`.\nThe documentation specifies the need for Python, pip, and git for setup and execution. It explicitly mentions pytest as the testing framework required to run the project's tests."
