It acts as the central entry point for understanding and interacting with the command-line application.\n\nCore Components:\n- Project Description: An overview of the utility's function to add two numbers from command-line input.\n- Installation Guide: Steps for cloning the repository, creating a Python virtual environment, and installing packages from `requirements.txt`.\n- Usage Instructions: Command-line syntax (`python src/main.py <number1> <number2>`) with examples for valid and invalid inputs.\n- Testing: Instructions for running the test suite using the `pytest` command.\n- Project Structure: A visual tree diagram of the project's directory and file layout.\n\nInternal Dependencies:\nThis documentation file describes the project's internal structure, including the roles of `src/main.py` (command-line entry point) and `src/calculator.py` (business logic).\n\nExternal Dependencies:\nThe file documents the project's reliance on Python 3 and the `pytest` framework for testing. It also references `requirements.txt` for managing package installations."
