The `run` function serves as the primary orchestrator, evaluating single expressions or managing the interactive loop which reads user input from standard input until a quit command is received.\n\nThe file depends internally on the `parser` module, specifically the `evaluate` function to compute results and the `ParseError` struct to handle and report calculation failures. Externally, it utilizes the `clap` crate's `Parser` trait for efficient argument parsing and the standard library's `std::io` module for handling standard input and output operations during the interactive session."
