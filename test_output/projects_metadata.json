It provides location transparency by extending the base ActorRef and implementing network communication logic, including message serialization and delegation of transport to the ActorSystem. It supports both fire-and-forget (tell) and request-response (ask) messaging patterns.\n\nCore Components: The RemoteActorRef<T> class is the primary component, providing public tell and ask methods for sending and receiving messages. It includes a private parseRemoteAddress utility for extracting connection details from a remote actor's address string.\n\nInternal Dependencies: This file imports ActorRef and ActorSystem from '../../core', Serializer from './serialization', and Logger from '../../utils/logger'.\n\nExternal Dependencies: None."

It manages the lifecycle and routing for sharded actors by initializing shard regions and proxies, abstracting the underlying distribution logic.\nThe `ClusterSharding` class is the primary API, offering a singleton `get` method to access the extension and an `init` method to configure sharding for specific actor types. It internally uses the `ShardingProxyRef` class to route messages to the correct shard, relying on `extractEntityId` and `extractShardId` functions.\nInternal dependencies include `ActorSystem`, `ActorRef`, `ActorContext`, and `Actor` from the core actor system, `Logger` for utility logging, and `ShardCoordinator` and `ShardRegion` from the same `sharding` module for orchestrating and managing local actor instances within a shard.\nThere are no external third-party library dependencies directly imported by this file."

It is responsible for initializing the system, creating system and user guardian actors, spawning new actors, managing their lifecycle (starting, stopping, restarting), and implementing fault tolerance through supervision strategies. This file provides the primary API for users to interact with and manage the actor hierarchy.\n\nCore Components: The `ActorSystem` class manages an internal registry of `ActorCell` objects, each encapsulating an actor's instance, reference, context, and mailbox. Key methods include `create` (singleton creation), `spawn` (for creating new top-level actors), `internalStop` (for controlled termination), and `terminate` (for system shutdown). It also contains private methods like `runMailbox` to process messages and apply supervision logic, and `createSystemGuardian`/`createRootGuardian` to set up the foundational actor hierarchy.\n\nInternal Dependencies: This file imports `Actor`, `ActorProps`, `ActorConstructor` from `./actor`; `ActorRef` from `./actor-ref`; `ActorContext` from `./actor-context`; `Mailbox` from `./mailbox`; `Logger` from `../utils/logger`; `Supervisor`, `SupervisionStrategy` from `../supervision/strategy`; and `PoisonPill`, `Failure` from `../types/messages`.\n\nExternal Dependencies: This file primarily relies on standard TypeScript/JavaScript features and the Bun/Node.js runtime environment (e.g., `Promise`, `setTimeout`), without explicit third-party library imports within the provided content."

It manages the lifecycle of Shard actors on a local node, acting as a proxy to route messages for specific entities to their corresponding shard or requesting shard allocation from the ShardCoordinator. The file also defines several message types used for internal communication within the sharding mechanism.\n\nCore Components: The ShardRegion class is an Actor responsible for orchestrating shards and entities. It handles messages like ShardRegionRegistered, ShardHomeAllocated, HandOff, and PassivateEntity. It internally spawns and manages Shard actors. The Shard class is an internal Actor that manages the lifecycle of individual entity actors within a specific shard, spawning them on demand and handling their passivation. Several message classes such as ShardEnvelope, RegisterShardRegion, GetShardHome, and PassivateEntity define the communication protocol within the sharding system.\n\nInternal Dependencies: It imports Actor, ActorProps, ActorRef, and ActorContext from the core actor system. The handle decorator from decorators/handle-message is used for declarative message handling. It utilizes the Logger utility for logging and PoisonPill from types/messages for actor termination.\n\nExternal Dependencies: No explicit third-party library imports are present in this file."

It manages shard lifecycle events and provides location transparency for sharded entities.\n\nCore Components: The file exports the ShardCoordinator class, which is a PersistentActor. It defines internal messages (RegisterShardRegion, RequestShardAllocation, ShardAllocated, ShardTerminated) and events (ShardRegionRegisteredEvent, ShardRegionRemovedEvent, ShardAllocatedEvent, ShardTerminatedEvent) for its operation. Key methods include preStart and postStop for lifecycle management, receiveRecover for state recovery, and message handlers like onRegisterShardRegion, onRequestShardAllocation, and onShardTerminated, alongside handlers for cluster membership events (onMemberUp, onMemberDown, onUnreachableMember).
