Rate Limiter with Multiple Strategies
Design a distributed rate limiting system supporting token bucket, leaky bucket, sliding window, and fixed window algorithms. Implement Redis-backed counters with Lua scripts for atomicity, support dynamic rate adjustment, and provide per-user/per-endpoint policies. Create type-safe configuration with Zod schema validation and middleware for Express/Fastify/Hono.

Key Features: Function overloads for different strategies, type-level configuration validation, branded types for rate limits, const type parameters, pipeline operator usage, assertion functions for guards
