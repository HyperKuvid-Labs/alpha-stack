Compile-Time Dependency Injection Container
Design a DI framework that resolves dependencies at compile time with zero runtime reflection. Implement circular dependency detection with type-level graphs, support scoped lifetimes (singleton, transient, request), and provide decorators for metadata. Generate dependency graphs with type validation, support async factory functions, and integrate with testing frameworks for mocking.

Key Features: Infer keyword for type inference, conditional types for dependency resolution, const assertions for configuration, symbol as injection tokens, proxy objects for lazy initialization, type-only imports for tree-shaking
