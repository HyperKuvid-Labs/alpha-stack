GraphQL Schema-First Code Generator
Create a code generator that produces fully-typed resolvers, DTOs, and client SDK from GraphQL schema. Implement schema stitching for federated graphs, support custom scalars with validation, and generate optimized DataLoader batching. Provide subscription resolvers with async iterables, implement field-level authorization with directives, and optimize with query complexity analysis.

Key Features: Utility types for GraphQL primitives, mapped types for resolver signatures, generic constraints for context types, type predicates for union resolution, overload signatures for flexible APIs, satisfies operator for type checking
