GPU-Accelerated Ray Tracing Engine with BVH
Create a physically-based path tracer using CUDA with bounding volume hierarchies for acceleration. Implement SAH-based BVH construction on GPU, support multiple importance sampling, and optimize with warp-level primitives. Use OptiX for denoising, implement texture compression with BC7, and support real-time updates for dynamic scenes.

Key Features: Device lambda functions, thrust for parallel algorithms, cooperative groups for warp operations, texture objects and surface writes, atomicCAS for lock-free updates, device host dual compilation
