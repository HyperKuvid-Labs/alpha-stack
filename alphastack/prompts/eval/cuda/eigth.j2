GPU-Based Spatial Index (R-Tree) for GIS
Implement a parallel R-tree construction and query algorithm on GPU for geospatial data. Support bulk loading with STR packing, concurrent insertions with atomic operations, and k-nearest neighbor search. Use thrust for sorting and partitioning, implement efficient bounding box tests, and provide spatial join operations.

Key Features: Structure of arrays (SoA) layout, Hilbert curve for spatial sorting, parallel tree traversal with stack, custom allocators for node pools, constexpr if for compile-time branching
