High-Performance Memory Allocator
Implement a custom memory allocator from scratch that outperforms jemalloc for specific workloads. Design a slab allocator for small objects, implement thread-local caching, and use lock-free data structures for allocation metadata. Support NUMA-aware allocation and provide hooks for memory profiling. Benchmark against standard allocators using criterion.

Key Features: Unsafe Rust and raw pointers, atomics and memory ordering, const generics for size classes, inline assembly for fast paths, FFI boundary design
