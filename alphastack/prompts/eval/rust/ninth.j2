Distributed Tracing and Observability System
Create an APM system that collects traces, metrics, and logs from distributed microservices. Implement sampling strategies, span aggregation, and time-series compression. Use OpenTelemetry protocol, design a columnar storage engine, and provide a SQL-like query language with a hand-written parser and query executor.

Key Features: Channels for actor-based concurrency, dashmap for concurrent collections, arrow2 for columnar data, async streams with futures-util, compile-time dependency injection
