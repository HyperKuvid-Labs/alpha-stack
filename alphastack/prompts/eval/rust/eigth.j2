GPU Compute Abstraction Layer
Design a high-level abstraction over CUDA and Vulkan compute for heterogeneous computing. Support kernel compilation from Rust code, memory transfers with pinned buffers, and multi-GPU orchestration. Implement a graph-based execution model with automatic dependency resolution and kernel fusion optimization.

Key Features: Build scripts for kernel compilation, bindgen for CUDA/Vulkan FFI, async GPU operations with futures, custom allocators for device memory, zero-cost abstractions with monomorphization
